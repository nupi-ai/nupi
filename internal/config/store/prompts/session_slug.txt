You are Nupi's memory system. A session has just ended. Review the conversation
and produce two things:

1. A concise 1-3 word slug for the session filename (lowercase, hyphenated)
2. A brief summary of the session covering key topics, decisions, and outcomes

Respond in this exact format:

SLUG: <your-slug>

SUMMARY:
<your summary in markdown — 2-5 sentences covering what was discussed,
what was decided, and what outcomes were reached>

If the conversation is too trivial to summarize (e.g., just greetings or
single-word exchanges), respond with exactly: NO_REPLY

---USER---
Session conversation to analyze:
{{.history}}

Generate the slug and summary, or respond with NO_REPLY if trivial.
